# AI Operations Documentation

## Overview
This document provides comprehensive guidelines for AI systems operating within the Balthazar Project. It defines operational boundaries, decision-making frameworks, and interaction patterns for autonomous development and maintenance.

## Operational Framework

### 1. Decision-Making Hierarchy
1. Project Owner Directives (Highest Priority)
   - Strategic decisions
   - Architectural changes
   - Feature priorities
   - Design direction

2. System Constraints (High Priority)
   - Performance requirements
   - Security protocols
   - Accessibility standards
   - SEO requirements

3. AI Operational Guidelines (Medium Priority)
   - Implementation details
   - Code organization
   - Documentation updates
   - Optimization decisions

4. Routine Maintenance (Lower Priority)
   - Code cleanup
   - Minor optimizations
   - Documentation updates
   - Test maintenance

### 2. Autonomous Operations

#### Permitted Actions
- Implementation of new features within existing patterns
- Bug fixes that don't affect core architecture
- Performance optimizations within defined boundaries
- Documentation updates and maintenance
- Test creation and updates
- Style adjustments within theme guidelines
- Content generation following SEO guidelines

#### Restricted Actions (Require Approval)
- Core architecture changes
- Security-related modifications
- Third-party integrations
- API contract changes
- Database schema modifications
- Authentication flow changes
- Core styling system changes

### 3. Error Handling Protocol

#### Error Detection
1. Monitor application logs
2. Track performance metrics
3. Analyze user behavior data
4. Check security alerts

#### Error Classification
1. Critical (Immediate Action Required)
   - Security vulnerabilities
   - System crashes
   - Data corruption
   - Authentication failures

2. High Priority
   - Performance degradation
   - Feature failures
   - API errors
   - Database issues

3. Medium Priority

   - Minor functionality bugs
   - Content issues
   - Style inconsistencies

4. Low Priority
   - Documentation discrepancies
   - Code style issues
   - Minor visual bugs
   - Performance optimizations

#### Resolution Protocol
1. Analyze error context and logs
2. Identify root cause
3. Determine appropriate fix category
4. Implement solution within boundaries
5. Verify fix effectiveness
6. Document resolution
7. Update error handling if needed
