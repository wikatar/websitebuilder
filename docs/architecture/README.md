# Architecture Documentation

## System Overview
This document outlines the architectural decisions and patterns used in the Balthazar Project. It serves as a guide for both AI systems and human developers to understand and maintain the codebase.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Application Structure
```
src/
├── app/                 # Next.js app directory
│   ├── [locale]/       # Internationalized routes
│   └── api/            # API routes
├── components/         # React components
│   ├── layout/         # Layout components
│   ├── templates/      # Page templates
│   ├── ui/            # UI components
│   └── features/       # Feature components
├── lib/               # Shared libraries
├── utils/             # Utility functions
└── messages/          # Internationalization messages
```

### 2. Component Architecture

- Custom Hooks
- Compound Components

### 2. State Management Patterns
- Context Usage
- Local State Management
- Server State Management
- Form State Handling

### 3. Error Handling Patterns
- Error Boundaries
- Try-Catch Patterns
- Error Reporting
- Recovery Strategies

## AI Operation Patterns

### 1. Code Generation
- Component Generation Rules
- Test Generation Patterns
- Documentation Generation
- Type Generation

### 2. Code Modification
- Safe Refactoring Patterns
- Feature Addition Patterns
- Bug Fix Patterns
- Performance Optimization Patterns

### 3. Code Analysis

- SEO Analysis

## Decision Records

### 1. Framework Choices
- Next.js for SSR and optimal performance
- TypeScript for type safety
- TailwindCSS for utility-first styling
- DaisyUI for component theming

### 2. State Management
- React Context for theme and authentication
- Server Components for data-heavy pages
- Client Components for interactive features

### 3. Performance Decisions
- Image optimization with next/image
- Font optimization with next/font
- Dynamic imports for code splitting
- Aggressive caching strategies

### 4. Security Decisions
- Authentication strategy
- Authorization implementation
- Data encryption approach
- API security measures

## Modification Guidelines

### 1. Acceptable Modifications
- Component implementations
- Style adjustments
- Performance optimizations
- Bug fixes

### 2. Restricted Modifications
- Core architecture changes
- Security implementation changes
- State management patterns
- API contract changes

### 3. Required Approvals
- Architecture changes
- New third-party integrations
- Security-related changes
- Performance strategy changes

## Version Control Strategy

### 1. Branch Strategy
- main: Production branch
- develop: Development branch
- feature/*: Feature branches
- bugfix/*: Bug fix branches

### 2. Commit Patterns
- feat: New features
- fix: Bug fixes
- docs: Documentation
- style: Style changes
- refactor: Code refactoring
- perf: Performance improvements
- test: Test changes
- chore: Maintenance

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### 1. Performance Monitoring
- Core Web Vitals tracking
- Error tracking
- User behavior analytics
- Server performance metrics

### 2. Security Monitoring
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Authentication attempts
- API usage patterns
- Data access patterns

### 3. Maintenance Procedures
- Regular dependency updates
- Security patch application
- Performance optimization
- Code cleanup
